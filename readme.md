#Rock-Paper-Scissors Project

This project is a standard rock paper scissors game which end when the user or the computer get to 10 points. However i included a modal that appears at the halfway stage, 5 points and the content and style is different depending on which player gets there first.

The same happens at the 10 points stage, style and content of the modal are different depending on who wins. If you are down at HT, but win at FT the styles and content are again different.
